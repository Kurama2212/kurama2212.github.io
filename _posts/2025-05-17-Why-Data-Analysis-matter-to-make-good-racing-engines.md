At this stage of my life, I’m facing several challenges related to Data Analysis.

Before starting my internship at a big company (let’s call it Kaneda Moto), the idea of learning how to code properly—just to make some “stupid plots” or look at Excel files—had never even crossed my mind. Like most kids who choose Automotive Engineering (or Mechanical Engineering—it’s basically the same), my childhood dream was, of course, to design astonishing wings for the next Ferrari F1 car or to run crazy fluid simulations full of colorful images. And yes, I was exactly that kind of guy.

So, what happened?

Well, my university isn’t a typical Mechanical Engineering faculty. It’s a unique program based in Modena, Italy, and every year it attracts students from all over who want to dive deep into the world of racing technology.

At the end of the program, I had to find a mandatory internship. One of the available positions was at Kaneda Moto. The description mentioned something about Neural Networks and Big Data. Honestly, I applied just because those words sounded cool—I thought they’d be a great addition to my CV.

But within the first two months, I began to understand what this field is really capable of. And it changed the way I think.

# The Change of Approach

At university, becoming a “real” engineer means passing a lot of exams. Most of them follow a familiar structure:

> Initial Data -> Application of theoretical physical principle -> do calculations -> comment the result

This is also the way of thinking engineering school tries to instill in you: structured, analytical, methodical.

And it’s absolutely necessary to understand the physical phenomena you’ll encounter in real life. This mindset helps solve 99% of problems—on paper.

But once you enter a real company, where real engineers face real-world challenges, your brain runs into a harsh truth:

> You have no fucking idea how to deal with COMPLEXITY

In recent years, complexity has increased exponentially. Yet the perception that most engineering students have of the job is still stuck in the mindset of 20 years ago. The Divide et Impera approach doesn’t cut it anymore. Now, you either simplify—and risk overlooking crucial factors—or you embrace the full complexity of the system.

And that’s exactly where Data Analysis comes into play.

# With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility
I'm not here to introduce you to Data Analysis or Machine Learning concepts. Instead, I want to share the potential these subjects have when applied to engine development.

In many typical design problems, a lot of decisions are made based on the engineer’s experience or intuition. These situations often arise when dealing with aspects that are hard to measure or quantify, and that involve the system as a whole—things like overall engine wear or the ideal racing line on a track.

The proper use of Machine Learning makes it possible to translate these vague, qualitative aspects into numbers—with astonishing precision.

This new problem-solving strategy brings with it an entirely new set of tasks that modern engineers must be ready to handle. Most of these involve managing, cleaning, structuring, and collecting datasets to train reliable models.

# Where This is Going
This experience didn’t just make me a better engineer.
It taught me how to think differently.
In a world where systems are getting more connected, more intelligent, and more unpredictable, Data Analysis is no longer optional. It’s the language of modern engineering.

I don't know where this path will take me, but I do know one thing: the future belongs to those who know how to turn raw data into real decisions.
